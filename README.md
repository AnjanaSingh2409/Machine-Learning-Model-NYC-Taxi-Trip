Predictive Model on NYC Taxi Trip Duration

To improve the efficiency of taxi dispatching systems for such services, it is important to be able to predict how long a driver will have his taxi occupied.
If a dispatcher knew approximately when a taxi driver would be ending their current ride, they would be better able to identify which driver to assign to each pickup request.

Here we will predict the Taxi Trip Duration using various Machine Learning Models.
